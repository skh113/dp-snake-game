# Snake Game with Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

The Snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around a grid, consuming food items while avoiding collisions with walls and itself. This project aims to implement this game with an AI agent capable of learning and improving its gameplay using dynamic programming and reinforcement learning algorithms.

## Features

- **Dynamic Programming**: We employ dynamic programming techniques to optimize the AI agent's decision-making process, enabling efficient pathfinding and movement planning.
  
- **Reinforcement Learning**: By implementing reinforcement learning algorithms, The AI agent learns from its actions and experiences, gradually improving its gameplay strategy over time.
  
- **User Interface**: The game features a user-friendly interface that allows players to interact with both the game environment and the AI agent.
